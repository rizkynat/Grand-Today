Features and limitations
------------------------

The project offers a small number of components that aim to directly reduce the development time of an
admin interface. It currently not yet offers a wide number of components to fully automate the
development of a gentelella interface.

Alternatives
------------

- angular2-webpack-starter-gentelella_
- `commercial angular templates`_
- `inspinia commercial template`_
- ng-admin_: one of the most well developed angular admin with a configuration system that is too advanced for my taste.
